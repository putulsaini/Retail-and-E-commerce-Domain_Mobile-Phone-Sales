# Retail Sales Dashboard: Visualizing Insights with Power BI

***Objective***:

- To analyze mobile phone sales data using Power BI, providing actionable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and payment methods within the Retail and E-commerce domain.

## Summary:

This Power BI project analyzes mobile phone sales data extracted from Kaggle and Excel. The data was cleaned, transformed using Power Query, and visualized using interactive dashboards. Key metrics like Total Sales, Total Quantity, MTD, QTD, and Year-over-Year comparisons were derived using DAX formulas. Insights reveal sales performance trends, preferred brands, and payment methods. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view for data-driven decision-making.

- Total Sales: SUMX(Sales_Data,Sales_Data[Units Sold]*Sales_Data[Price Per Unit])

- Same Period Last Year: CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Custom_Calender[Date].[Date]))

- Rating Status: IF(Customer Ratings >= 4, "Good", IF(Customer Ratings > 2, "Average", "Poor"))

- QTD and MTD Calculations

- Average Price: AVERAGE(Sales_Data[Price Per Unit])
